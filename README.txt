Written by: David Smith

The Lexical Analyzer, a pivotal component of our compiler project, serves as the first step in processing source code. Designed to tokenize input, it meticulously scans and identifies lexical units, such as keywords, identifiers, and symbols. The generated tokens act as the foundation for subsequent phases, facilitating seamless integration into the broader compiler framework. This meticulous lexical analysis contributes to the overall efficiency and accuracy of the compilation process.
